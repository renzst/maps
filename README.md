# maps

This repositories hosts all my mapping projects, whether they be new or old. They're in varying states of completion and formats, from QGS project files and exports to Openlayers projects and beyond.

Some themes in here:
  - Food deserts and foodsheds
  - Evictions
  - Data exports related to affordable housing
